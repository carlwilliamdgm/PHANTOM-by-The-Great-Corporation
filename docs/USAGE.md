## Tips and Best Practices

### For Best Performance

1. **Use Wi-Fi for lowest latency**
   - 5GHz Wi-Fi is better than 2.4GHz
   - Stay close to router
   - Avoid network congestion

2. **Use USB for zero latency**
   - Requires ADB setup
   - Best for competitive gaming
   - Most reliable connection

3. **Adjust deadzone**
   - Higher deadzone reduces drift
   - Lower deadzone increases precision
   - Find the right balance

4. **Calibrate sensors**
   - Calibrate gyroscope before use
   - Reset calibration if drifting occurs
   - Place on flat surface for calibration

### Battery Optimization

1. **Reduce screen brightness**
2. **Disable unused features**
3. **Use Wi-Fi instead of cellular**
4. **Close background apps**

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Input lag:**
- Switch to UDP connection
- Try USB connection
- Reduce distance between devices
- Close other apps

**Connection drops:**
- Check network stability
- Try different connection type
- Ensure server is running
- Restart both devices

**Buttons not responding:**
- Check connection status
- Verify server is receiving input
- Restart the app
- Reconfigure button mappings

## Keyboard Shortcuts (Server)

When the server is running:

- `Ctrl+C` - Stop server
- Check logs for connection status
- Monitor latency in logs
