## Python Server Installation

### Step 1: Install Python

1. Download Python 3.10+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Run the installer and check **"Add Python to PATH"**
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

### Step 2: Install ViGEm Bus Driver

The ViGEm Bus driver is required for gamepad emulation on Windows.

1. Download ViGEm Bus from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases)
2. Extract the downloaded archive
3. Run `ViGEmBusDriverSetup.exe` as Administrator
4. Follow the installation wizard
5. Restart your computer

### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies

1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install:
   - `vgamepad` - Xbox 360 gamepad emulation
   - `websockets` - WebSocket server
   - `pyautogui` - Keyboard/mouse control
   - `pybluez` - Bluetooth RFCOMM
   - `asyncio-mqtt` - Async I/O
   - `pyserial` - Serial communication

### Step 4: Configure the Server

Edit `server/config/server_config.json` to customize settings:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "udp_port": 8888,
    "websocket_port": 8889,
    "bluetooth_port": 8887,
    "usb_port": 8890
  },
  "gamepad": {
    "emulation_type": "xbox360",
    "vibration_enabled": true,
    "deadzone_left": 0.1,
    "deadzone_right": 0.1
  },
  "keyboard_mouse": {
    "enabled": true,
    "sensitivity": 1.0
  },
  "connection": {
    "max_clients": 4,
    "reconnect_interval": 5,
    "timeout": 30
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Start the Server

Run the server:
```bash
python main.py
```

You should see:
```
INFO - Starting Virtual Gamepad Server...
INFO - Gamepad emulator initialized successfully
INFO - Starting UDP server on 0.0.0.0:8888
INFO - UDP server listening on 0.0.0.0:8888

## Troubleshooting

### Server Issues

**Server won't start**
- Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed
- Verify all dependencies: `pip list`
- Check if ports are already in use
- Run as Administrator if needed

**ViGEm Bus driver not working**
- Reinstall ViGEm Bus driver as Administrator
- Restart your computer after installation
- Check Device Manager for "ViGEm Bus Device"

**Connection refused**
- Check Windows Firewall settings
- Allow Python through firewall
- Verify IP address is correct
- Ensure both devices are on the same network

### Android Client Issues

**App won't install**
- Enable "Install from unknown sources"
- Check Android version compatibility (7.0+)
- Clear storage and reinstall

**Permissions denied**
- Grant all required permissions in Settings
- For Android 12+, grant "Nearby devices" permission
- Restart the app after granting permissions

**Connection failed**
- Verify server is running
- Check IP address and port
- Ensure both devices are on the same network
- Try different connection type (UDP → WebSocket)

**Bluetooth HID not working**
- Verify Android version is 9.0+
- Check if device supports HID profile
- Some manufacturers restrict HID access
- Try "The Great" mode as alternative

### Performance Issues

**High latency**
- Use Wi-Fi instead of Bluetooth
- Try USB connection for zero latency
- Reduce distance between devices
- Check network congestion

**Input lag**
- Adjust sensitivity settings
- Reduce deadzone values
- Close other apps on Android
- Use UDP instead of WebSocket

**Haptic feedback not working**
- Enable vibration in app settings
- Check device vibration motor
- Verify server has vibration enabled

### ADB Issues

**ADB not recognized**
- Install Android Platform Tools
- Add ADB to system PATH
- Restart Command Prompt after installation

**Device not found**
- Enable USB debugging on Android
- Accept debugging prompt
- Try different USB cable
- Restart ADB server: `adb kill-server && adb start-server`

**Port forwarding fails**
- Check if port is already in use
- Remove existing forwarding: `adb forward --remove tcp:8890`
- Run ADB as Administrator

## Next Steps

After successful installation:

1. **Configure your controller layout**
   - Open Layout Editor
   - Position buttons and joysticks
   - Customize appearance

2. **Adjust sensitivity**
   - Fine-tune joystick sensitivity
   - Set appropriate deadzones
   - Calibrate gyroscope if using motion controls

3. **Create profiles**
   - Save different configurations for different games
   - Import/export profiles for backup

4. **Test in games**
   - Start your game
   - Verify controller recognition
   - Adjust settings as needed
